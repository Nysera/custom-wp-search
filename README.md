# Custom WordPress Search

The purpose of creating this project is that I wanted to learn how to create a custom search form on WordPress for later projects.

This project was a bit tricky mainly due to not knowing a lot about WordPress and PHP but I managed to get a working version done which I'm currently happy with.

## What I practiced in this project
* Learned a lot about wordPress itself and how it works
* Basic PHP
* Practiced Javascript
